# FoodTruckProject

# Overview
Users will input and rate a list of food trucks, then view the average rating and the highest-rated truck.

Structure
You will define a FoodTruck class with fields for a unique numeric id, a name ("TacoRific", "Mediterranean Medic", etc.), food type ("Tacos", "Falafel", etc.), and a numeric rating.

You will create a separate class with a main method that starts the program. It will have an array to store up to five FoodTruck objects. The main method of this class is the only static method in the entire project.

User Stories
User Story #1
The user is prompted to input the name, food type, and rating for up to five food trucks. For each set of input, a FoodTruck object is created, its fields set to the user's input, and it is added to the array. The truck id is not input by the user, but instead assigned automatically in the FoodTruck constructor from a static field that is incremented as each truck is created.

User Story #2
If the user inputs quit for the food truck name, input ends immediately and the program continues.

User Story #3
After input is complete, the user sees a second menu from which they can choose to:

List all existing food trucks.
See the average rating of food trucks.
Display the highest-rated food truck.
Quit the program.
User Story #4
After a selected menu item finishes its action, the menu redisplays, allowing the user to select again, until the user selects the option to quit.
